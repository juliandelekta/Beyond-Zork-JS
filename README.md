# Beyond Zork JS
A port to *JavaScript* of the Infocom game, **Beyond Zork**.

## About *Beyond Zork* JS
Released in 1987, **Beyond Zork** is an interesting interactive fiction with some RPG components but mainly focus on puzzle solving.
For years this jewel remains inaccesible for most of us, because we didn't have the specific computer.
Today there are many virtualizations programs and online tools that let you play the game, but... I need something simpler

So for you IF lovers, I bring you Beyond Zork JavaScript edition, to run it whenever you want. It is simple, small and offline.

Some of the code were transpiled from ZIL to JS using a tool (a little ugly) that I made.
I tried to hold the most part of the code untouched, just doing some minor fixes in order to get de I/O system working correctly.

## Installation & Usage
It's just and old style single page application.
So just copy and paste it whenever you like.
To use it, open the *beyond.html* in a web browser.

## Contributing
The code is far from being perfect, so pull request are welcome :)
